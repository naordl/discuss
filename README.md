## Live Test

I have deployed this project on Vercel, feel free to test it out:

## Introduction

This is a personal project which resembles a reddit clone/alternative web application written in the full-stack framework NextJS.

The application architecture is monolithic, which is unsuitable for certain use-cases, but works perfectly for a passion project that does not need horizontal scaling.

It features `NodeJS` in the back-end, `React` in the front-end, a `Postgresql` database, as well as production grade authentication through `GitHub OAuth`.
